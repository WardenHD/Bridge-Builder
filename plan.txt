Python Project

Main Idea: 
I decided to make simple 2d game in CLI. The game is called "Bridge Builder". It will be about building a bridge from blocks with different shapes. It won't have real physics, but will have a special feature. 

Special Feature
To win a game, the bridge needs to be valid.  The game checks whether first line of the bridge doesn't have blank spaces and other lines if they have at least 3 different types of blocks

Notes
 • You have only 1 attempt to build the bridge
 • The map will be always flat, but have different elevation
 • You cannot remove placed block
 • You can have different profiles
 • If you lose, your profile score will get 0
 • In DB (SQL), the number of wins for every profile is stored
 • The text will be colored with ansi escape codes
 • Only keys on keyboard for controls, no input()


Plan
 ✓ Make UI
 ✓ Make block placement
 ✓ Make testing
 ✓ Make saves
 ✓ Make actionbar
 ✓ Make map generation
 ✓ Make keyboard input recorder
 ✓ Make coloured print 
 ✓ Make cursor movement
